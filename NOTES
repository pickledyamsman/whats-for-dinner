ANGULAR

[X]- Must use an Angular Front-End that includes at least 5 pages

[X]- Must contain some sort of nested views
  -- click to bring up new restaurant form onto current page.

[X]- Must contain some sort of searching as well as filtering based on some criteria. Ex: All items in the "fruit" category, or all tasks past due
  -- find restaurant based on multiple filters.

[X]- Must contain at least one page that allows for dynamic updating of a single field of a resource. Ex: Allow changing of quantity in a shopping cart
  -- create new restaurant that will add to list dynamicly

[X]- Links should work correctly. Ex: Clicking on a product in a list, should take you to the show page for that product

[X]- Data should be validated in Angular before submission

[X]- Must talk to the Rails backend using $http and Services.
